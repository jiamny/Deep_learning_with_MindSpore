Checkout Density Based Spectral Clustering Blag:
https://blog.dominodatalab.com/topology-and-density-based-clustering/

- Compared to centroid-based clustering like k-means, density-based clustering works by
identifying “dense” clusters of points, allowing it to learn clusters of arbitrary shape
and identify outliers in the data.
